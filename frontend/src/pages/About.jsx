          <p style={{ marginBottom: '20px', lineHeight: '1.6' }}>
            Comida Africana began as a dream to introduce the rich and vibrant flavors of Nigerian cuisine to Tijuana. 
            Our founder, Chef Ade, moved to Mexico in 2020 and noticed the lack of authentic African dining options in the area.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '20px', lineHeight: '1.6' }}>
            Having grown up cooking traditional Nigerian dishes alongside his grandmother, Chef Ade decided to share his 
            culinary heritage with his new community. What started as small pop-up events quickly gained popularity, leading 
            to the establishment of our restaurant in 2023.
